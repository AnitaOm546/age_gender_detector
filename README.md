# Age and Gender Detector  

> A deep learning-based application that predicts a person’s age and gender from facial images. Developed and trained in Kaggle Notebook using CNNs on Kaggle’s “Gender and Age Detection” dataset, and deployed with a Streamlit UI for easy, real-time image-based predictions.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This is my personal **Age and Gender Detector** project that predicts a person’s gender (Male/Female) and estimates their age from facial images.  
I developed and trained the model in a **Kaggle Notebook**, using facial image data sourced from **Kaggle’s “Gender and Age Detection” dataset**.  
The trained model was saved as a `.h5` file and integrated into a **Streamlit-based user interface** so anyone can use it without coding knowledge.

## 🧠 Features
- Predicts **gender** (`Male` / `Female`) from an uploaded image  
- Estimates **age** as a number or range  
- Accepts **image uploads** and gives instant results  
- Runs on a **pre-trained CNN** for fast predictions  
- Accessible through a **Streamlit web interface**

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle – *Gender and Age Detection dataset*  
- **Content**: Thousands of labeled facial images  
- **Processing**: Resized to 48×48 pixels, normalized, and augmented for better performance

## 🚀📈 Model Performance
- Gender Accuracy: ~XX%
- Age Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~X.X years
- Model Type: Multi-output CNN with two separate prediction layers

## 📌 My Learning from This Project
- Applied multi-output deep learning for real-world image prediction
- Learned how to take a trained model from Kaggle and deploy it locally with a UI
- Built a Streamlit app to make ML predictions accessible to non-programmers
